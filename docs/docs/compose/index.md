# Compose

There are two types of UI tests you can write with Compose.

1. Kotlin Multiplatform UI test ([Kotlin documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-test.html))
2. Platform Specific JUnit-based tests ([Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing))

Ultron supports both types of UI tests and make it`s development much easier.
